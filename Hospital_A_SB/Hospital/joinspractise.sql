 --NATURAL JOIN	
--1.	The join operation which is used to merge two tables depending on their same column name and data types is known as natural join.
--2.  Here, the final table will accommodate all the attributes of both the tables and doesnâ€™t duplicate the column.

--INNER JOIN 
--1. Inner joins have a specific join condition. Here, the join operation is used to form a new table by joining column values of two tables based upon the join-predicate.
--2. Here, the final table will accommodate all the attributes of both the tables and it also holds the duplicate columns.
